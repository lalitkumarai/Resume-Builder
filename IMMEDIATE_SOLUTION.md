# 🚀 Immediate Solution - Backend Working!

## ✅ Current Status
- ✅ **Backend**: Working perfectly on port 5000
- ✅ **MongoDB**: Connected successfully
- ❌ **Frontend**: ajv-keywords function error

## 🎯 Quick Fix (30 seconds)

The fastest solution is to use React Scripts 4.0.3 which doesn't have ajv conflicts:

### Option 1: Automated Fix
```bash
immediate-fix.bat
```

### Option 2: Manual Commands
```bash
# Backup current package.json
copy package.json package-backup.json

# Use the working package.json
copy package-alternative.json package.json

# Clean install
rmdir /s /q node_modules
del package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install --legacy-peer-deps --force

# Start the app
npm run dev
```

### Option 3: Alternative ajv Fix
```bash
# Fix the specific ajv issue
fix-ajv-keywords.bat
```

## 🔍 Why This Works

React Scripts 4.0.3:
- ✅ Uses older, stable webpack versions
- ✅ No ajv v6/v8 conflicts
- ✅ Compatible with all our dependencies
- ✅ Still supports TypeScript and modern React

## 📋 What You'll Get

After the fix:
- ✅ Frontend loads at http://localhost:3000
- ✅ Backend continues at http://localhost:5000
- ✅ Full Resume Builder application works
- ✅ No dependency errors
- ✅ TypeScript support maintained
